Repository dedicated to object detection projects

YOLO Project - This project detects objects in real time, whether on a webcam, 
camera or even connected to a digital TV,
and the project also has a connection to a database (MySQL).
When the object is detected, it is saved in the database with the object name, 
date and time (hours and minutes). 
When the program starts, as soon as it detects an object, 
a circle in the upper left corner is activated. 
When you click on this circle a tab opens containing the name of the object, 
a description of the object, and a link to the object

Project Counter - This project counts how many vehicles are passing on the highway and classifies the type of vehicle, which can be cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks, etc
